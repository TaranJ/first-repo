GameHub is an online shop where users can purchase computer games.

## Description

This is a website for an imagined gaming marketplace that lets you buy tons of video games online for any device. Designing and creating it was part of my front-end course at Noroff School of technology and digital media.

The target audience is aged 18 to 25 and are interested in computer games. They would would either like to purchase games or would like to sell games they have finished playing.

The website includes these pages:

- Home
- List of games
- A games page showing the product details
- Checkout page with shopping cart functionality
- Checkout success
- About
- Contact

The product content is stored on a headless WordPress installation with the Woo Commerce plugin, and is fetched through WordPress REST API.

## Built With
